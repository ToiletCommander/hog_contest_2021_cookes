## Design Concept
Since @ToiletCommander studied `XSTAT 2` during his freshman Fall19 FPF Semester, he considered using a probability model to estimate the win rate for rolling `n` dices at a given point to compete in the HOG contest.   

This turns out initially to not work well because final_strategy was designed to work based on the history of the game.

Win Rate(Against More_Boar): 0.637709008522221
